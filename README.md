Basketball Survey Quiz using JavaScript

This is a basketball inspired quiz which was made using vanilla JavaScript. I used DOM to select the classes and ID.

I also used arrays to store the correct answers and hence I could use a forEach function 
for loop through the users answers and compare the users answers to the array with the correct answers.
